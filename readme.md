## 👋 Hi there, this is Ivy 

### 💻 I'm a Program Manager, Data Scientist, Entrepreneur and Content Creator

I've always been a firm believer in people investing in their learning and development, positioning themselves for success and giving back to their community. This is what motivates me to do everything I do, especially to inspire more African women to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.

I currently work on Open Education Analytics at Microsoft, which is an open source project where we collaborate with education systems across the world to develop modern data intelligence capabilities.
